To make this project work effectively, you'll need to:

1. Gather Data:
Historical fuel prices
Crude oil prices
    https://data.economie.gouv.fr/api/explore/v2.1
    https://data.economie.gouv.fr/api/explore/v2.1/catalog/datasets/prix-des-carburants-en-france-flux-instantane-v2/records?limit=20
Economic indicators
Seasonal factors
Supply and demand metrics

2. Feature Engineering:
Create time-based features
Calculate moving averages
Add relevant economic indicators
Include seasonal indicators

3. Model Selection:
Start with Random Forest (as shown)
Consider other models like:
LSTM for time series
XGBoost
Prophet (Facebook's forecasting tool)

4. Evaluation:
Use appropriate metrics for time series
Implement cross-validation
Consider prediction intervals

5. Visualization:
Create charts for:
Historical prices
Forecasted values
Model performance

6. Deployment:
Create a web interface
Deploy the model using Flask
Set up a deployment platform (e.g., Heroku)

7. Monitoring:
Monitor the model performance

8. Documentation:
Document the process
Include data sources
Explain the model selection
Provide instructions for deployment

9. Testing:
Test the model with new data
Check for overfitting
Validate the model on historical data

10. Maintenance:
Regular updates
Error handling
Performance monitoring
Documentation updates

11. Data Preprocessing:
Handle missing values
Normalize data
Create lag features

12. Model Training:
Split data into training and testing sets
Train the model
Evaluate the model
